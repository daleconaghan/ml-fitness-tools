# ML Fitness Tools ðŸ’ªðŸ¤–

Week 4/260 of shipping ML code every week.

ðŸ“… **Roadmap:** [View all upcoming features here](ROADMAP.md)

## What's This?
I'm building machine learning tools for serious lifters. Every week for 5 years, I'll ship something new that uses ML to make training smarter.

## Completed Projects

**Week 1: RPE Volume Calculator** (Aug 8, 2025)
- Adjusts training volume based on Rate of Perceived Exertion
- Calculates effective training stress, not just weight Ã— reps Ã— sets  
- Foundation for all future predictions

**Week 2: Strength Predictor** (Aug 8, 2025)  
- Linear regression model using training history
- Predicts next workout: 78.8kg Ã— 5 reps
- Model confidence: 100%

**Week 3: Recovery API** (Aug 15, 2025)  
- FastAPI server with REST endpoints
- Recovery score calculation based on sleep, stress, soreness
- HTTP API for RPE calculations and strength predictions
- Auto-generated documentation at `/docs`

**Week 4: Overtraining Risk Detector** (Sep 10, 2025)
- Advanced ML algorithm detecting overtraining risk (0-100%)
- Multi-factor analysis: training load trends, RPE inflation, recovery metrics
- Risk levels: Low/Moderate/High/Critical with deload recommendations
- New `/overtraining-risk` API endpoint

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daleconaghan/ml-fitness-tools.git
cd ml-fitness-tools
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the API server
python recovery_api.py

# Or run individual tools
python week2_strength_predictor.py
```

## API Usage

Start the server: `python recovery_api.py`

**Available endpoints:**
- `POST /calculate-rpe` - Calculate RPE-based metrics
- `POST /predict-strength` - Predict next workout strength  
- `POST /recovery-status` - Get recovery score and recommendations
- `POST /overtraining-risk` - Detect overtraining risk with recommendations
- `GET /health` - API health check
- `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation

**Example API calls:**
```bash
# Check recovery status
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/recovery-status" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "last_session_rpe": 8.5,
    "hours_since_training": 36,
    "sleep_quality": 7.0,
    "stress_level": 4.0,
    "muscle_soreness": 3.0
  }'

# Detect overtraining risk
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/overtraining-risk" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recent_sessions": [
      {"weight": 225, "reps": 5, "rpe": 8.5},
      {"weight": 230, "reps": 5, "rpe": 9.0}
    ],
    "sleep_quality_avg": 6,
    "stress_level_avg": 7,
    "motivation_level": 4,
    "resting_hr_trend": 8
  }'
```

## The Journey

âœ… **Week 1**: RPE Calculator

âœ… **Week 2**: Strength Predictor  

âœ… **Week 3**: Recovery API

âœ… **Week 4**: Overtraining Risk Detector

â¬œ **Week 5** (Aug 29): Workout Plan Recommender

â¬œ **Week 6-260**: Building the future of training

---

**Next Week**: Auto-generated workout plans. ML recommends weekly training based on your last 4 weeks of data.

Building at the intersection of machine learning and strength training.
