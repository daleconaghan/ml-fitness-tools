# ML Fitness Tools ðŸ’ªðŸ¤–

**Week 2/260** of shipping ML code every week.

## What's This?

I'm building machine learning tools for serious lifters. Every week for 5 years, I'll ship something new that uses ML to make training smarter.

## Completed Projects

### Week 1: RPE Volume Calculator (Aug 8, 2025)
- Adjusts training volume based on Rate of Perceived Exertion
- Calculates effective training stress, not just weight Ã— reps Ã— sets
- Foundation for all future predictions

### Week 2: Strength Predictor (Aug 8, 2025)
- Linear regression model using training history
- Predicts next workout: **78.8kg Ã— 5 reps**
- Model confidence: 100%

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daleconaghan/ml-fitness-tools.git
cd ml-fitness-tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
python week2_strength_predictor.py
```



The Journey

âœ… Week 1: RPE Calculator
âœ… Week 2: Strength Predictor
â¬œ Week 3 (Aug 15): Recovery API
â¬œ Week 4-260: Building the future of training

Next Week
Building an API to serve predictions via HTTP. Turn ML models into something anyone can use.

Building at the intersection of machine learning and strength training.
