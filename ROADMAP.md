# ML Fitness Tools Roadmap 💪🤖
_Tracking every feature, every week — 260 weeks of shipping ML code for serious lifters._

## 📅 Build Schedule
**Goal:** Ship 1 machine learning tool for lifters every week for 5 years (260 weeks).
**Status:** 5/260 completed ✅

## ✅ Completed
| Week | Date         | Feature | Summary |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | ------- |
| 1    | Sep 5, 2025  | **RPE Volume Calculator** | Adjusts training volume based on Rate of Perceived Exertion. Calculates effective training stress, not just weight × reps × sets. Foundation for all future predictions. |
| 2    | Sep 12, 2025 | **Strength Predictor** | Linear regression model using training history. Predicts next workout weight × reps with confidence score. |
| 3    | Sep 19, 2025 | **Recovery API** | FastAPI server with REST endpoints. Recovery score calculation, HTTP API for RPE calculations and strength predictions. Auto-generated docs at `/docs`. |
| 4    | Sep 26, 2025 | **Overtraining Risk Detector** | Advanced ML algorithm detecting overtraining risk (0-100%). Multi-factor analysis with risk levels and deload recommendations. |
| 5    | Oct 3, 2025  | **Workout Plan Recommender** | AI-generated weekly workout plans based on last 4 weeks of training data. Progressive overload calculations with automatic volume adjustments. Supports multiple training goals and adapts for recovery score. |

## 🔜 Upcoming
| Week | Date         | Feature | Goal |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | ---- |
| 6    | Oct 10, 2025 | **Exercise Substitution Engine** | Suggest replacement exercises based on available equipment and target muscle groups. |
| 7    | Oct 17, 2025 | **Plateau Breaker AI** | Detect stalled lifts and suggest strategies to break plateaus (rep schemes, accessory work, deloads). |

## 📈 Long-Term Vision (Weeks 8–260)
- **Nutrition Log Integrator** — combine training + diet data for recovery predictions  
- **Sleep Tracker Import** — merge sleep metrics for holistic readiness scoring  
- **1RM Predictor** — dynamic estimation of true max strength based on recent training  
- **Fatigue Accumulation Model** — track cumulative stress over weeks/months  
- **Custom Goal Optimizer** — build plans based on strength, hypertrophy, or endurance goals  
- **Full Mobile App Integration** — ML tools embedded in a lifter-friendly UI  
- **Open API for Developers** — allow anyone to build on top of ML Fitness Tools
