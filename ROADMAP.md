## âœ… Completed
| Week | Date        | Feature | Summary |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1    | Aug 8, 2025 | **RPE Volume Calculator** | Adjusts training volume based on Rate of Perceived Exertion. Calculates effective training stress, not just weight Ã— reps Ã— sets. Foundation for all future predictions. |
| 2    | Aug 8, 2025 | **Strength Predictor** | Linear regression model using training history. Predicts next workout weight Ã— reps with confidence score. |
| 3    | Aug 15, 2025 | **Recovery API** | FastAPI server with REST endpoints. Recovery score calculation, HTTP API for RPE calculations and strength predictions. Auto-generated docs at `/docs`. |
| 4    | Sep 10, 2025 | **Overtraining Risk Detector** | Advanced ML algorithm detecting overtraining risk (0-100%). Multi-factor analysis with risk levels and deload recommendations. |

## ðŸ”œ Upcoming
| Week | Date        | Feature | Goal |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- | ---- |
| 5    | Aug 29, 2025 | **Workout Plan Recommender** | Auto-generate weekly workout plans based on last 4 weeks of data. Adjusts volume, intensity, and exercises to keep progress steady. |
| 6    | Sep 5, 2025  | **Exercise Substitution Engine** | Suggest replacement exercises based on available equipment and target muscle groups. |
| 7    | Sep 12, 2025 | **Plateau Breaker AI** | Detect stalled lifts and suggest strategies to break plateaus (rep schemes, accessory work, deloads). |

## ðŸ“ˆ Long-Term Vision (Weeks 8â€“260)
- **Nutrition Log Integrator** â€” combine training + diet data for recovery predictions  
- **Sleep Tracker Import** â€” merge sleep metrics for holistic readiness scoring  
- **1RM Predictor** â€” dynamic estimation of true max strength based on recent training  
- **Fatigue Accumulation Model** â€” track cumulative stress over weeks/months  
- **Custom Goal Optimizer** â€” build plans based on strength, hypertrophy, or endurance goals  
- **Full Mobile App Integration** â€” ML tools embedded in a lifter-friendly UI  
- **Open API for Developers** â€” allow anyone to build on top of ML Fitness Tools
